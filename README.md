# PG800C Synthesizer Programmer 
**Clone the PG-800 programmer for Roland JX-10, MKS-70 and JX-8P or get creative. Here are some ideas for this library**

PG-800C::buzz & possibilities
-----------------------------

 - Ever wanted to tweak sounds on your Super JX-10, MKS-70 or JX-8P synth with real knobs but canâ€™t afford the humongous price tag on PG-800?
 - Control your analog monster synth from your modular gear with CV?
 - Storing presets on SD cards (*somewhat limited use as we can only store setting from PG-800 panel*)
 - Create USB host with ATmega32U4 board so you can use modern midi controllers without proper midi connector to alter sounds on PG800 port.
 - **How about using a ESP8266 Series MCU to create a Wi-Fi receiver to alter sound parameters on JX/MKS over your Wi-Fi network?**

PG-800C::buzz for PG-800 owners
-------------------------------

 - Merge CV inputs with PG-800 parameters sent to synth
 - Convert PG800 out data to MIDI to work as standard MIDI controller
 - Control multiple or selected JX/MKS from one PG-800 without the need for reconnecting wires?
